    <h1>Week 6</h1>
    <h2>Daily Standups:</h2>
    <img src="assets/tuesday.jpg" alt="Tuesday" id="day-card">
    <h2>3<sup>rd</sup> June 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I started developing my HiFi prototype.</p>
    <p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No major blockers, though I’ve been feeling a bit low on energy and momentum as the project nears the end.</p>

    <h2>4<sup>th</sup> June 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I worked on my HiFi prototype, and it felt like things were really starting to come together. There’s not a huge amount to say, but I was enjoying the process and it was satisfying to see the design start to come to life.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll keep progressing with my HiFi prototype, building on what I worked on yesterday and aiming to get it presentation-ready.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Not really, just trying to stay focused and keep things moving forward.</p>

    <h2>5<sup>th</sup> June 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I continued developing my HiFi prototype. Like the day before, it was rewarding to see everything taking shape. It’s been a steady and enjoyable stretch of progress without any major complications.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>Today I’ll be presenting my Work in Progress presentation. I’ll use it as an opportunity to share my current branding and prototype development, and gather feedback for the next stage.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Nothing specific, although I am feeling my energy levels drop as I near the end of the project.</p>

    <h2>6<sup>th</sup> June 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>Yesterday I did my Work in Progress presentation. I think it went well, the visual design and type scale were complimented, and I received useful suggestions to help refine the app.</p>
    <p>Melody advised me to avoid describing the app as “simple and easy” in my pitching and encouraged me to think more carefully about how I communicate its purpose. She also recommended checking my colour contrast for accessibility and increasing spacing between elements like headings and cards to improve readability.</p>
    <p>Simon gave feedback on alignment and layout. He stressed the importance of avoiding centred text, as left alignment is more accessible and easier to read. He also encouraged me to reuse layout structures more consistently to strengthen the visual hierarchy and make it easier to code. The overall impression was that I’m close to the finish line, and some focused refinement will help give Reclaim a polished result.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I won’t be doing any university work today as I’ll be travelling to Hamilton for work. Over the weekend, I plan to begin implementing the feedback so that my HiFi prototype is ready to be coded from Monday.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No blockers, though I won’t be working on uni tasks today due to the work trip.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective:</h2>
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• I made good progress on my HiFi prototype this week and enjoyed seeing the design start to take shape.</li>
        <li>• Delivering my Work in Progress presentation was a positive step, and the detailed feedback from Melody and Simon gave me clear directions for improvement.</li>
        <li>• Despite some dips in energy, I’ve been able to maintain momentum as I move closer to the final stages of the project.</li>
    <p><strong> What didn’t go well?
 </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Work commitments meant less time for university tasks, which disrupted my flow.</li>
        <li>• Energy levels have been fluctuating, making it harder to stay consistently motivated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What can be improved?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• The presentation feedback showed there’s still fine-tuning needed, especially around consistency and layout priorities.</li>
        <li>• Plan ahead for work-related interruptions to minimise their impact on my study time.</li>
        <li>• Focus on implementing feedback quickly to keep on top of revisions and avoid last-minute pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What will I try next week?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Monitor my motivation levels honestly and allow myself breaks when needed to stay productive without burning out.</li>
    </ul>
