    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <h2>Daily Standups:</h2>
    <img src="assets/monday.jpg" alt="Monday" id="day-card">
    <h2>12<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I spent time finalising my UX research. I created personas and mapped out current and future state journeys. I also worked on prioritising features across potential release phases for my solution.</p>
    <p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No blockers today.</p>

    <h2>13<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I finalised UX documentation, including user journeys and feature prioritisation.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll concentrate on finalising a formal competitor analysis and outlining my business model. My aim is to clarify how the product will function within its market, as well as explore potential monetisation and growth opportunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>None today.</p>

    <h2>14<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I worked on my competitor analysis and business model planning.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m going to focus on my proof of concept. I'll collect examples and references that align with my idea and explore different UI directions that I could use as inspiration. We’re going to discuss creative media strategies during class and how we might apply them to our projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ve found the deliverables for the brief and the proof of concept a bit challenging to get my head around. It’s been a bit of a mental block today, but I’m slowly working through it.</p>
    <img src="assets/thursday.jpg" alt="Thursday" id="day-card">
    <h2>15<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I looked into proof of concept approaches and gathered UI inspiration. I also spent time thinking through how to approach the brief strategically.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>Today I’m compiling all the work I’ve done so far and finalising my proof of concept write-up. I’ll begin designing slides for next week’s pitch presentation and start adding content to my design strategy document. I’m also coding my blog and uploading all my pre-written stand-ups from the week.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>The deliverables and proof of concept had me feeling stuck yesterday and earlier today, but I’m getting more clarity now and moving past that.</p>

    <h2>16<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I finalised my proof of concept and began adding content to my slides and design strategy document. I also updated my blog with all my stand-up notes from the week.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be working on my Type Summative, which I’ve been putting off a bit. I also plan to continue developing my design strategy document and slide deck. I’ll carry this work through the weekend to make sure everything’s in good shape for next week’s presentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No blockers today.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective:</h2>
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Finalised UX research including personas and user journeys.</li>
        <li>• Created a formal competitor analysis and drafted a business model.</li>
        <li>• Made good progress on the proof of concept and UI inspiration.</li>
        <li>• Started designing slides and the design strategy document in preparation for next week’s pitch.</li>
        <li>• Blog is up to date with all stand-up notes.</li>
    <p><strong> What didn’t go well? </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Struggled with understanding the deliverables for the brief and proof of concept mid-week. It slowed progress slightly until I was able to clarify things.</li>
        <li>• Haven’t made as much progress on the Type Summative as I should have.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What can be improved?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Try to stay on top of all project tasks (especially the Type Summative) to avoid a backlog.</li>
        <li>• When deliverables feel overwhelming or unclear, break them into smaller steps sooner to prevent momentum loss.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What will I try next week?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Keep refining the proof of concept and presentation slides.</li>
        <li>• Begin working on wireframes or prototypes to communicate the solution more clearly.</li>
        <li>• Dedicate focused time to catching up on the Type Summative and ensure it doesn’t get left behind.</li>
    </ul>
