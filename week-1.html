<h1>Week 1</h1>
<img src="assets/monday.jpg" alt="Monday" id="day-card">
<h2>28<sup>th</sup> April 2025</h2>
<p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
<p>I organised all the files and folders for my storage account, downloaded the briefs, read through them carefully, and set up and linked my GitHub, Netlify, and site repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
<p>None today.</p>

<h2>29<sup>th</sup> April 2025</h2>
<p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
<p>I set up my storage account files and folders, reviewed the briefs carefully, and connected my GitHub, Netlify, and repositories.</p>
<p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
<p>I will complete my first formative for the term and begin brainstorming problems related to the brief.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
<p>None today.</p>

<h2>30<sup>th</sup> April 2025</h2>
<p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
<p>I worked on my first formative task, which was to build a demo cupcake site. I really enjoyed this because I got to use photos from my baking passion project during COVID, and it was exciting to imagine what the concept could have been if brought to life.</p>
<p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
<p>I will plan out the term, start forming my problem statement, and begin conducting desk research to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
<p>Work has been taking up a lot of time, so I have not been able to focus on university tasks as much as I would like, and I feel I am falling behind.</p>

<h2>1<sup>st</sup> May 2025</h2>
<p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
<p>We covered the Agile methodology for productivity. I started working on my schedule but did not manage to finish it. I researched several problems faced by 25- to 30-year-olds in New Zealand, summarised them into categories, and selected one that I felt had strong potential.</p>
<p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
<p>I will finalise my term planner by adding all the summatives, formatives, and tasks. I will also work on coding my blog.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
<p>None today.</p>

<h2>2<sup>nd</sup> May 2025</h2>
<p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
<p>I completed my planner, which gave me a clear roadmap for the term. I also worked on coding my blog and caught up on stand-ups from this week. I received feedback from Melody on my idea, and I plan to continue developing and researching it. She recommended that I also speak to Simon for further input.</p>
<p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
<p>Today is the Type Brief production day! I will work on that, aim to get feedback from Simon, and continue with my research.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
<p>There is some uncertainty about whether my idea is the right direction. If it is not, I may need to start over, which is worrying as I do feel I am already a bit behind. Fingers crossed!</p>
