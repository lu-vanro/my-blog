    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Daily Standups:</h2>

    <h2>19<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I started drafting a user flow. Instead of jumping straight into wireframes or placing generic boxes on a screen, I sketched screen ideas and wrote the process out in bullet points. It felt like a mix between a lo-fi prototype and a visualisation of my thought process. I’m a bit unsure if skipping wireframes might work against me, but my app concept feels pretty simple.</p>
    <p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Not really, but I have been uncertain about whether skipping stages like wireframes is the right move, even though the app concept feels simple.</p>

    <h2>20<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I sketched out my user flow and mapped the process with bullet points to better understand my concept.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be working on my visual direction by creating four mood boards. I’m starting to feel more confident about how to structure them and what to include, which is a nice development. I’ve got a clear idea in mind for my logo, so I’ll go straight into creating it.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>The brief is very broad with what feels like, at times, little clarity on what exactly we’re meant to deliver. While I get that the flexibility is intentional, it’s made it hard to focus and stay motivated. I do feel less alone knowing that other students are feeling the same way, however the lack of clear goals is affecting my motivation and creating a sense of being behind. This is starting to feel more like freelancing than a structured project, which isn’t ideal.</p>

    <h2>21<sup>st</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I created four mood boards to define my visual direction and finalised my logo.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be designing my Stylescape. This will include curating some design elements and styling them with the right colours, which takes time. I’ll also draft a mock-up of what the app’s landing screen could look like. Lastly, I’ll begin designing my pitch presentation slides, which are due on Thursday morning.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m still wrestling with the vague brief and unclear expectations, which continues to affect my focus.</p>

    <h2>22<sup>nd</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I created my Stylescape and some key brand design elements. I also mocked up a landing screen and started my pitch presentation slides.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll finish my presentation slides this morning before the 10am deadline. After that, I’ll spend the rest of the day working on my design strategy document. In the evening, I’ll collate all my stand-up notes and upload everything to my blog for Friday’s submission.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No specific blockers today.</p>

    <h2>23<sup>rd</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I finished my presentation slides and submitted them. I also worked on my design strategy document and updated my blog with this week’s stand-up notes.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>Today is presentation day and I’ll be doing my pitch at midday. I’m feeling nervous but I’m hopeful for positive feedback. After that, I’ll spend the rest of the day finishing my design strategy document, which is due by 5pm. I’ve also been meaning to work on my Type Brief but I’ve hit a wall, so I plan to mull it over on the weekend and figure out how to move forward.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No new blockers for this project today, though the block around my Type brief is frustrating.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective:</h2>
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• I completed everything I needed this week, including finishing my pitch presentation and submitting my design strategy document on time.</li>
        <li>• Made solid progress on my visual direction, with four mood boards, a finished Stylescape, and a finalised logo.</li>
        <li>• Developed my brand elements and a mock-up landing screen, which helped bring the concept to life.</li>
        <li>• Kept organised by keeping up to date with my stand-up notes and documentation.</li>
    <p><strong> What didn’t go well?
 </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• The brief’s broad scope and lack of clear deliverables made it hard to build momentum. I understand the intention behind creative freedom, but the lack of structure was challenging.</li>
        <li>• Balancing work and study is tough, as work’s clearer deadlines and structure have made it easier to focus there.</li>
        <li>• I didn’t make progress on my Type brief and felt stuck with it, which I need to tackle over the weekend.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What can be improved?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Develop better strategies for balancing work and study, especially when study tasks feel less defined.</li>
        <li>• Acknowledge feelings of frustration or being stuck, but push myself to keep moving forward despite them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What will I try next week?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Focus on what I can control, remembering that my current circumstances are challenging but temporary, and that doing my best is enough.</li>
    </ul>
