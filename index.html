    <p><em>A weekly blog documenting how I progress with the 'New Enterprises' assignment.</em></p>
    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <p>It’s the year 2027. As a recent graduate of Media Design School, you decide to put your design skills toward setting up a new social and/or commercial enterprise in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>

    <p>Demonstrate the important contribution design can make to social, cultural and community well-being, quality of life and identity. Use a lean human-centred design approach to determine the concept and scope of the enterprise, and the interactive product or service that this enterprise offers.</p>

    <p>Your designed solution must relate to an identified present-day, real world problem.</p>

    <p>You will need to consider an appropriate target market carefully so that you can tailor your solution, test appropriately and promote your enterprise across relevant media channels.</p>

    <p>Pitch your idea with a presentation and a design strategy document, reflect on your weekly design sprints, and present your final response.</p>
