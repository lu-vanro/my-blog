    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Daily Standups:</h2>

    <h2>26<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I finally finished my typography poster. After a week of being completely stuck, the idea just clicked. I’d spent the weekend experimenting with different directions after feeling like I couldn’t code the original concept. I reached a point where I wanted to scrap the original idea completely and start fresh. However, on Monday morning, something fell into place and the solution worked. Although this blog is meant to focus on the main project and not the Type Brief, I’ve talked about both throughout, so it feels worth noting that the poster is now complete and off my plate.</p>
    <p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>We have a large job happening at work at the moment, an annual agricultural expo, that’s taken a lot of time and energy. It’s been difficult to balance that with my school workload, and I expect it to continue being a blocker throughout the week.</p>

    <h2>27<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I completed my typography poster, which felt like a breakthrough. It was a real relief to have that done.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m going to reach out to the original participants I interviewed earlier in the project to get feedback on the branding. I’ll also research similar app UIs to help clarify my visual rationale and build a stronger foundation for the direction I want to take.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>The ongoing workload from work continues to be a time and energy drain. It’s making it hard to focus on school work.</p>

    <h2>28<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I contacted participants from my initial user interviews and gathered their feedback on the updated branding direction. I also started researching app interfaces to help build a stronger rationale for my visual direction.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m going to begin working on my HiFi prototype and continue refining the visual direction of the app.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Work demands… But I’m trying to push through.</p>

    <h2>29<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I made a start on my HiFi prototype and continued refining my branding. I also spoke with Melody and Simon about my visual direction. They encouraged me to work on my logo and font choices but confirmed I could keep my chosen illustration style.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’m going to explore new fonts and logo options and start applying these to mock-ups within my app design.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>I have my sister-in-law’s graduation dinner tonight, so I won’t have as much time to work as I’d like. Juggling personal commitments alongside work and study continues to be tricky.</p>

    <h2>30<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I tested out several font and logo options and applied them to mock-ups of the app UI. I continued building my HiFi prototype.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>Today I’ll be working on my brand guidelines and progressing further with the HiFi prototype.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>A close friend will arrive in town today and will be staying with us over the weekend. Between that and the demands of work, I’m finding it difficult to stay focused on my school work.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective:</h2>
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• I finished my typography poster after feeling stuck for over a week, which was a big relief. The breakthrough came after experimenting with new ideas, and it helped restore some momentum.</li>
        <li>• I refined my brand direction based on lecturer feedback, including researching similar apps and reworking my logo and fonts.</li>
        <li>• I started building my HiFi prototype and my brand guidelines.</li>
        <li>• I managed to juggle feedback, revisions, and new tasks fairly well, despite some major distractions during the week.</li>
    <p><strong> What didn’t go well?
 </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Juggling full-time work, uni, and personal commitments was extremely difficult this week. A large job at work, a graduation dinner, and a visiting friend all made it harder to focus.</li>
        <li>• I didn’t feel like I was able to give uni as much attention as I would’ve liked, which added to my stress. </li>
        <li>• I’ve been struggling with self-doubt… Wondering if my work is actually any good, or just average. In an oversaturated industry, feeling average can be incredibly discouraging. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What can be improved?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Find ways to give my schoolwork the attention it deserves, even when work and life are demanding. </li>
        <li>• Create a bit more structure around personal projects so I don’t lose traction when life gets in the way. </li>
        <li>• Try to remind myself that feeling uncertain or uncomfortable doesn’t mean I’m failing, it often just means I’m growing. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What will I try next week?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Keep pushing forward even when things feel unclear or hard, reminding myself that the discomfort is part of the process. </li>
        <li>• Reflect on the feedback I got from Simon about how we’re being fast-tracked for industry, and try to trust that the pressure and growing pains will pay off. </li>
        <li>• Be honest with myself about where I’m at emotionally and mentally, and allow space for those feelings without letting them derail me. </li>
    </ul>
