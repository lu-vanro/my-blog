    <h2>Daily Standups:</h2>
    <img src="assets/monday.jpg" alt="Monday" id="day-card">
    <h2>5<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I completed three out of five interviews and continued with desk research on my chosen problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Were there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Work has been quite demanding recently, which has made it difficult to dedicate as much time to university tasks as I would like. </p>

    <h2>6<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I completed three interviews and carried on with my desk research.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I plan to finish the remaining two interviews and begin analysing the insights and pain points that came out of them.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Work is still taking up a lot of time.</p>

    <h2>7<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I finished the last two interviews and started analysing the pain points and insights.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be doing more research into productivity apps and gamified apps, identifying themes from my findings, and selecting one final insight to focus on. I’ll also begin working on a solution for the brief and prepare slides for my Work in Progress presentation on Friday.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>None today.</p>

    <h2>8<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I did more research into productivity apps and gamified apps, identified themes from my findings, and selected one final insight to focus on. I also began working on a solution for the brief and submitted my slides for my Work in Progress presentation on Friday.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be taking part in an interview for another student and will try to keep working on my research. I’m not sure how much I’ll manage, as I’ve got a lot going on with work. This evening I plan to code my blog and add all my standup notes from the week, which I’ve been keeping on a digital sticky note.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>Work continues to be a major time drain.</p>

    <h2>9<sup>th</sup> May 2025</h2>
    <p><strong>What did I do yesterday?</strong></p>
    <p>I took part in an interview for another student and kept working on my research, although I didn't get much done. In the evening, I coded my blog and added all my standup notes from the week, which I had been keeping on a digital sticky note.</p>
    <p><strong>What will I do today?</strong></p>
    <p>I’ll be giving my Work in Progress presentation today. After that, I’m planning to continue with my UX research, including over the weekend. By Sunday evening, I would like to have finalised my business goals, competitive analysis, case studies, personas, and user journeys.</p>
    <p><strong>Are there any blockers?</strong></p>
    <p>No blockers today.</p>
    <h2>Retrospective:</h2>
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Completed four out of five interviews and gathered valuable insights.</li>
        <li>• Identified a final insight to focus on after analysing the interviews.</li>
        <li>• Started working on a solution for the brief.</li>
        <li>• Prepared and submitted slides for the Work in Progress presentation.</li>
        <li>• Coded my blog and documented all my standup notes, keeping everything organised.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What didn’t go well?
 </strong></p>
     <ul>
        <li>• The fifth interview didn't record due to privacy restrictions on the recording app. I conducted the interview over a phone call, but the app blocks audio from regular phone calls, which I only discovered afterwards.</li>
        <li>• Lost the audio and couldn't retrieve it; I was also unable to re-interview the participant. I've moved forward with only four interviews instead of five.</li>
        <li>• Work and caring for my partner, who has been ill with the flu, added extra strain and limited my time for university tasks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What can be improved?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• Double-check the recording setup, especially for phone interviews, to avoid similar issues in the future.</li>
        <li>• Once my partner recovers and my workload eases, I'll be in a better position to balance university, work and personal responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What will I try next week?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>• I will try to limit the amount of work on my plate next week and adjust my schedule to make the most of any free time available.</li>
    </ul>
